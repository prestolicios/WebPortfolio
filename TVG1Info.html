    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> TVG reconstruction </h1>
    <p> This was one of the most challenging things I approached this semester. I was tasked with recreating the first video game console ever. The main challange was that we only had pictures to reference and the rough schematics of another student. In the beginning it was hard to identify the components in the picture and see how they corellated to the ones in front of us. We eventually started making progress through hours of drilling and tedious soldering, we are curently about half way done and should be able to test the console out soon!</p>
